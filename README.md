# PostgreSQL-and-Python
Jupyter Notebook is a great software to catalog steps taken during data visualization and analysis. It supports Python code, markdown, HTML and PostgreSQL. This allows to write SQL code right in the notebook and make changes, or query the database from there. It also allows to convert any query into a pandas dataframe.

In this repository three databases have been queried to answer some questions using PostgreSQL and Python.
